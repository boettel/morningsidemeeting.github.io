          Morningside Monthly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends,
          formed in 1973, is a welcoming, diverse community of individuals
          living the Quaker testimonies of equality, integrity, simplicity,
          stewardship of the earth, and peace.

          Morningsiders come from a variety of faith backgrounds, and accept a
          variety of beliefs about the divine and our relationship to scripture.
          It is believed that Morningside was the first Meeting anywhere to take
          a same-sex marriage under its care and affirm the right of all couples
          to name their relationships as they choose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Members and attenders of Morningside Meeting also work together in
          committees to advance peace, racial justice, and prison reform. We
          care for and tend to each other's physical, psychological, and
          spiritual well-being.
        </p>
        <p>
          We gather for silent worship every First Day (Sunday) morning at 11
          oâ€™clock. Traditionally, we meet at Riverside Church in Manhattan.
          Currently we hold hybrid meetings, with most members attending via
          Zoom and a small number gathering together and connecting from
          Riverside. <strong>All are welcome.</strong>
