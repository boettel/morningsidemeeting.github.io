      <h2>A Brief History of Morningside Monthly Meeting</h2>
      <p>
        From our origins as an informal worship group meeting on the campus of
        Columbia University in the winter of 1957-58, Morningside grew into a
        preparatory meeting under the care of New York Quarterly Meeting (1960),
        then blossomed into a monthly meeting in 1973, and finally became fully
        self-supporting in 1990. In July of 2002, we moved from the Columbia
        campus to the tower of Riverside Church, and have been “permanently” at
        home on the twelfth floor since 2007. For most of our history, we have
        maintained a fairly constant number of members (55-60).
      </p>
      <p>
        Unencumbered by the need to attend to the upkeep of a physical home, we
        are free to devote our resources to outreach, and to concerns for peace
        and social justice. A significant portion of our annual budget is
        distributed, via our Peace and Social Concerns Committee, to a variety
        of organizations who work to improve the quality of life of those whom
        they serve. We tend to focus on small organizations, for whom our modest
        contributions will make a noticeable difference, and on organizations
        that serve the local community, regardless of their religious
        affiliation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our lack of a Meetinghouse has presented particular challenges as we
        have labored together to create a loving community. We have met those
        challenges by establishing spiritual nurture groups, conducting mid-week
        meetings in each others’ homes, holding periodic retreats, and forming
        discussion groups on a wide variety of topics.

        It is believed that Morningside was the first Meeting anywhere to take a
        same-sex marriage under its care with the marriage of John Bohne and
        William McCann on May 30, 1987. Other meetings had held “Ceremonies of
        Commitment” for same-sex couples, but Morningside was the first to
        affirm the right of all couples to name their relationships as they
        choose.

        Support committees for those among us who are facing personal
        difficulties – or are embarking on new personal, professional, or
        spiritual journeys – are regularly established by our Committee on
        Ministry and Counsel.

        While attendance at our First Day School has fluctuated over the years,
        we are always prepared to welcome children, and work together to find
        ways to introduce them to a life lived in the Light, in accordance with
        the Quaker testimonies of equality, simplicity, integrity, and peace.

      <h2>A Brief History of the Quakers</h2>
      <p>
        The term “quakerism” is believed to be a term of derision given to
        17th-century Friends because they “quaked” before the Spirit. Like many
        religious groups, they were persecuted because they rejected the
        standard structures of the established church and forms of worship.
      </p>
      <p>
        George Fox and other important early Friends, including Margaret Fell
        (who would marry Fox) and James Nayler, believed that a priestly class,
        vestments and religious symbols stood in the way of true worship.
        Referring to John 15:15, early Quakers saw themselves as “friends” to
        that of God in all.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        The seminal Quaker writing from this period is the Journal or
        Autobiography of George Fox, which describes the spiritual journey of a
        young man who, failing to discover answers in the existing (state)
        religion, found solace in silent worship, replacing theological
        questions with personal experience and continuing revelation.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        18th century Friends were led to see the inherent contradiction between
        the freedom of the Spirit and the ownership of human beings, and to
        begin questioning all moral argumens for slavery. Leaders like John
        Woolman, who, in The Journal of John Woolman (1774), recounted his
        40-year campaign to persuade slave-owning Friends to free their slaves,
        emphasized that the fact that God was within us all was inconsistent
        with the ownership of slaves. Woolman also saw dress as a socioeconomic
        statement. He refused to wear cotton and eliminated collars and dyed
        fabric from his wardrobe, not in order to create a Quaker aesthetic, but
        because cotton and buttons and dyes were produced with slave labor and
        wearing those products validated the system of slavery.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the 19th century Friends experienced a period of Quietism in which
        they ceased any activity in the political arena and struggled to
        establish a shared identity. In the end Friends split into two sects
        largely along economic and social lines. That schism between evangelical
        and non-evangelical Friends continues to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the 20th Century writers such as Rufus Jones reinvigorated Quakerism
        by framing it as simultaneously mystical and practical. Jones was one of
        the founders, in 1917 of the American Friends Service Committee (AFSC),
        to provide alternative service programs for conscientious objectors in
        World War I. His combination of mysticism and service has come to define
        Quakerism today. An excellent collection of digitized works of Jones and
        other Quakers is available at HathiTrush.org. In 1943, a group of
        Friends founded the Friends Committee on National Legislation (FCNL) in
        order to lobby for changes in national legislation to make the nation's
        laws more consistent with Quaker testimonies and values, especially the
        peace testimony. FCNL is a “nonpartisan, multi-issue advocacy that
        connects historic Quaker testimonies on peace, equality, simplicity, and
        truth with peace and social justice issues.”
